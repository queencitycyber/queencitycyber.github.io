### Introduction to Wireshark

Chances are you've used Wireshark in the past. We will be using Wireshark to sniff and interpret network traffic to and from other local machines within our network.

There are a number of network sniffing/protocol analysis tools that are similar to Wireshark and we will briefly touch on them as well, but given Wiresharks ubiquitous use in the infosec field, we will use that whenever possible.



Wireshark is a GUI application that can sniff, analyze, and decode hundreds of different protocols. For example, Wireshark can decode VoIP \(Voice over IP\) packets, and can reconstruct them and can play back audio of a phone conversation.
