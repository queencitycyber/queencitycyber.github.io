**FOCA \(Fingerprinting Organizations with Collected Archives\)**

This is another Java GUI that is used for data mining and OSINT, focusing on metadata extraction and file analysis. It can analyze a variety of documents including Microsoft Office/Open Office documents, PDFs, as well as Adobe InDesign and SVG files. It can then extract information from these files such as the name of the person who created the file, last edited the file, the OS the file was created on and with what technology. This is incredibly useful information for a penetration tester.
