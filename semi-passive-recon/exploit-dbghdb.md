**Google dorking**

We touched very briefly on the concept of dorking. Lets see if we can modify some search queries to look for specific files or information. Here is a list of common Google dorks:



1. Specify the specific domain with site:domain and some word that might return some useful information \(configuration, password, private, admin, etc \)

`site:uc.edu inurl:configuration`



No results. Let’s try an alternate wording of configuration and just try “config”. Two interesting looking results



It seems there is a machine operating with Linux kernel 3.5.3. I wonder if there are any known vulnerabilities in this kernel?



Quite a few! Lets try looking for files. Here we are strictly searching for the term “salary” \(intext:salary\) in any website under the uc.edu domain \(site:\*.uc.edu\) and we are only looking for PDFs \(filetype:pdf\). There are many other filters that will allow you to find some intersting stuff if you get familiar with the syntax and combine unique searches and get creative.
