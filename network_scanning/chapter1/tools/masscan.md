# Basic Introduction to Masscan



Masscan is really awesome. The main about Masscan that is different is it's speed. 

From the author - " This is the fastest Internet port scanner. It can scan the entire Internet in under 6 minutes, transmitting 10 million packets per second."  

Masscan is really fast for a couple reasons:

1. Custom TCP/IP network stack
2. Packets are generated and sent asynchronously 



Masscan is also very similiar to Nmap. It even has an --nmap switch to see what Nmap compatibility  switches are available.

Run `masscan --nmap` to view what switches are similar across Nmap and Masscan
