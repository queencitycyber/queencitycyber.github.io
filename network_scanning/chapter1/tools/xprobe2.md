# Basic Introduction to xprobe2

Xprobe2 is another tool used for OS detection, however it is an active tool. It interacts and probes remote systems and compares returned signatures to a known database. It can also scan open ports, but we will use it for OS detection in the next section as we have better, more robust tools like Nmap for scanning open ports
