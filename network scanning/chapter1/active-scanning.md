# Passive Scanning

* Our primary goal here, again, is to keep the number of packets we send to a target system as little as possible. To do efficient analysis, we need to master the art of analyzing responses, not actively probing.

There are several ways to do passive analysis on a target. One of the most common ways is network traffic analysis and a tool that does this will is p0f. We will examine this tool in the next session.
