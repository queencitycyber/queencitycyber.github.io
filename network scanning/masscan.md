Like most things, there is a tradeoff between speed and accuracy, especially when it comes to scanning. 

The use of automated tools is much more convenient and greatly decreases our scanning speed, but depending on several things, such as network/link speed, traffic congestion, and what services are available to us, our accuracy may decrease leaving a penetration tester with an inaccurate impression of the target and/or network. Enter manual tools.



We will only touch briefly on one tool. That tool is Netcat.
