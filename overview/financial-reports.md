**Financial Reports**

Viewing financial documents can often reveal not just key financial information, but can also reveal key personnel that might not show up under normal searching conditions. Specifically, we are looking at EDGAR, which is the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system, which is a database owned by the SEC that contains statements regarding registration and information companies who are required by law to file. We may also find executive statements regarding compensation, names and addresses of common/majority stock owners, future business places, and economic risk factors. The two specific reports from within EDGAR that are often revealing are the 10-K Annual report and the 10-Q quarterly report.
