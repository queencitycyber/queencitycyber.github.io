# The Mindset:

Remember, you're a researcher/tinkerer/hacker! Think like one!

Ask yourself questions like:

* What does this button/input form/combination of letters + numbers do?
  * Ex: A pizza delivery web site might ask for your address: what happens if I enter in a phone number? 10 phone numbers?
  * Ex: A web application might have a forum/discussion board and asks for your name: what if I enter HTML characters into the name form?
