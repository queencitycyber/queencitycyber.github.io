### Nessus

A very popular vulnerability scanning tool.

From their site - "Nessus is the most trusted vulnerability scanning platform for auditors and security analysts. Users can schedule scans across multiple scanners, use wizards to easily and quickly create policies, schedule scans and send results via email. Nessus supports more technologies than any other vendor, including operating systems, network devices, hypervisors, databases, tablets/phones, web servers and critical infrastructure."

We will be using Nessus to scan target machines.
