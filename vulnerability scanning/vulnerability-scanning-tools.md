#### Introduction to network vulnerability scanning tools

* Though there are many vulnerability scanning tools, we will only focus on a few select few, primarily based on their cost \(free! at least trial version\), popularity, and robustness/features.

In this section, we will focus on network scanning tools, omitting web application scanners until we get to that section in the course. For a list of web scanning tools, check out OWASP's list here - [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Vulnerability\_Scanning\_Tools](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Vulnerability_Scanning_Tools)
