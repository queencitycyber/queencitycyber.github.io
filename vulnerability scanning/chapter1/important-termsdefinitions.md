# Review of Metasploit Framework and MSFConsole 

The Metasploit Framework \(MSF\) is a security project that is a wealth of information regarding security vulnerabilities and exploits. It is a collection of exploits, network reconnaissance tools, web vulnerability plugins, and much more that you can utilize during a penetration test.

One of the most popular Metasploit Framework interfaces is the MSFconsole. The MSFconsole provides an “all-in-one” centralized console which allows you to efficiently and effortlessly take advantage of the Metasploit Framework. One of the most powerful features of the MSFconsole is its ability to rapidly configure and exploit a vulnerability against a target machine by delivering a payload. After identifying a vulnerability on a system, MSFconsole can be used to find the exploit information through its vast database of vulnerabilities, and deliver a payload which will then exploit the vulnerability and allow access to a system. MSFconsole is renowned for its simplicity when it comes to configuring payload parameters such as the target system IP address. 

When exploiting a target with MSFconsole, Metasploit offers several types of payloads that it can drop on a system including:

* Command Shell: Enables users to run collection scripts or run arbitrary commands against the host.

* Meterpreter: Flexible payload that offers tons of functionality and flexibility. 

* Dynamic payloads: Enables users to evade anti-virus defenses by generating unique payloads.

* Encoder: A program which encodes our payloads to avoid antivirus detection.
