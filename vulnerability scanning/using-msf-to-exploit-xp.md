## Exploiting Windows XP using Metasploit Framework

#### Using Metasploit to exploit a vulnerability and gain access.

#### 

##### Proposed Scenario:

We know from our reconnaissance that there are several different operating systems and services running on a target network. When first looking for a vulnerability to exploit, it is important to take note of the version a specific service or OS is running. A good starting point is looking for out-of-date software or systems. This is because out-of-date software usually lacks the vulnerability fixes \(called patches\) that software updates provide. If software is out-of-date, there is a good chance a vulnerability for it exists and your target is vulnerable.

Looking back at our trusty reconnaissance information, we can see a Windows XP system exists on the network. This is great for us because we know Microsoft ended support for its popular Windows XP operating system on April 8th, 2014. Even though Microsoft pleaded with the tech community to upgrade, many did not heed the warning. Using this information, we can reason the Windows XP system is vulnerable as it lacks the critical vulnerability patches Microsoft no longer provides.
