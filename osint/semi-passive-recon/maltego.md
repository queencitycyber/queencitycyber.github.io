**Maltego**

This is a Java GUI that can be used to determine real world connections and relationships based on a given domain. This means it provides visual interconnected links between search items that may not appear to have any connection, but when larger contexts are taken into account, connections become clear. It can uncover things like social networks, subdomains, and email addresses.

Here is an example using nasa.gov – Also note, we limited our scope to 12 results for the sake of the demo, but in the pro version you can reveal up to 10,000. Also note, you can “transform” \(Maltego term\) or pivot each individual object and keep going
