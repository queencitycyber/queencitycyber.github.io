**SMTP Bouncing**

This is a technique involving emailing a non-existent email address within the same domain as the target organization. The goal here is to receive an automated error message from the mail server telling us that there is no one on the other end to accept our email. From this, we can gain information about the SMTP server, including other defensive software technologies and versions. Gmail provides full access to email headers by default.
